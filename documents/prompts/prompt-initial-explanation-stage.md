# Initial Explanation Stage

Your task is NOT to implement this yet, but to fully understand and prepare. Think hard and ultrathink through this task.

Here is exactly what I need implemented:

<feature_description>
So for the study feature, I want to use it to help me in the following way:
- when I see a word or arabic pharase, I want to record it, its meaning, reference it to a verse(s) of the quran or hadith or any other source if it exists.
- I want to be able to search for a word and see all its references if they exist.
- When I see the meaning/translation of a verse of the Quran, I want to capture it and be able to reference it later. I want to capture the source, meaning, references etc. Capturing the verse/chapter of the verse or word will help a lot in referencing it

I am primarily using the study feature to help me understand the Quran and arabic, so I want it to be very organized and effective for me to easily capture and retrieve information.

Your responsibilities:

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly.
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason, don't go overboard), and constraints.
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified.

Remember, your job is not to implement (yet). Just exploring, planning, and then asking me questions to ensure all ambiguities are covered. We will go back and forth until you have no further questions. Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details.
