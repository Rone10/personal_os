# Initial Explanation Stage

Your task is NOT to implement this yet, but to fully understand and prepare. Think hard and ultrathink through this task.

Here is exactly what I need implemented:

<feature_description>
 I want you to add a rich text editor to the books and courses feature in /study. Currently only has a text box. Give it the rich text editor and allow me to enter notes and use the features we currently have (notes, tags, books, courses, verses, etc). I want to be able to reference the features we have.
</feature_description>

Your responsibilities:

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly.
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason, don't go overboard), and constraints.
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified.

Remember, your job is not to implement (yet). Just exploring, planning, and then asking me questions to ensure all ambiguities are covered. We will go back and forth until you have no further questions. Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details.
