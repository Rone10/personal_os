# Initial Explanation Stage

Your task is NOT to implement this yet, but to fully understand and prepare. Think hard and ultrathink through this task.

Here is exactly what I need implemented:

<feature_description>
 I want to have the ayah number at the end of the ayah (arabic) when I visit
  http://localhost:3700/study?view=verses&type=verse&id=nx728pagxhnmp49zvemgswr4v57z2q0n. Also when adding a verse range, the
  translation section should give me a text field for each verse so that it's easy to read. I also want the translation to be
  added automatically when adding a verse. Give me a dropdown option of which translations I want. for each ayah, give me the
  option to have upto 4 translations for each ayah. By default I want to have 2 translations: the clear quran and sahih international. Carefully think about this

Your responsibilities:

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly.
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason, don't go overboard), and constraints.
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified.

Remember, your job is not to implement (yet). Just exploring, planning, and then asking me questions to ensure all ambiguities are covered. We will go back and forth until you have no further questions. Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details.
